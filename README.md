# solana-learn

Why?
I wish to learn more about Blockchains and Rust. My hypothesis is that one can strategically orient their careers in the direction which increase entropy in our world. History is an evidence that entropy always increases and its the only direction in which the world is expected to progress.

I choose Blockchains and cryptocurrencies because I feel they increase the entropy of the world order. People are getting fed up of Governments and Fiat order. I mean how preposterous is it that Governments can dilute our savings by a factor of 50% for political gains? I see money as something which buys time. We work today, store our time in the form of Money and decide to use it later. However, this Money can be diluted if some individuals decide to do it. You are diluting my time reserves, my happiness and my freedom. I say NO!

I chose Solana because I understand that most of Solana programs are written in Rust. 

Learning about blockchain development will help me delve deeper into DeFi trading strategies and Rust thus honing my skills in both directions.
